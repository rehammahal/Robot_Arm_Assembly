This repo is about assemble parts of the robot arm that I got from https://github.com/smart-methods. as my first mechanical department task in my summer training at Smart Methods Company.

To assemble the robotic arm,
Follow the instructions:
1- Go to https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm
2- Choose arduino_robot_arm/robot_arm_pkg/meshes/stl/
3- Print the whole pieces
4- In assemble step, start with the base piece
5- Put the waist piece above the base
6- Then put the Arm01 piece
7- Then put the Arm02 piece
8- Finally  put the Grapper piece

You Got It.. 

Note: I assembled these robotic arm using Tinkercad.

Actually, this is my first time working on 3D programs.
